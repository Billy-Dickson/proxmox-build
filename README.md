## Proxmox Build

 In January this year (2023) bought myself a cheap PC from AliExpress £157, 16G of memory and a cheap NVME drive and a cheap 1TB SSD Drive.

 Total spend about £250, with the hope of teaching myself about Proxmox, Virtualization and Docker.

 ### PC Specification  

 [Firewall Mini PC Pentium N6005 N5105](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003991560461.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.4.37b51802ONX0sX) 4*Intel i226-V 2.5G Lans 2*DDR4 2*M.2 NVMe AES-NI Home Router PC Network Security Appliance.

 I installed the Proxmox SD on the NVME drive and used the SSD drive to store running virtual machines, I've been using it for a number of months  and I've had no issues to speak of
